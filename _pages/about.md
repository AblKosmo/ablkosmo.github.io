Hi!
I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis. 
My research interests include security and privacy, large language models, prompt-injection attacks, 
web tracking/measurement, and AI-powered browsing agents.
I am currently working on projects involving large-scale web measurement using BrowserUse, 
LLM agents, and CDP instrumentation for analyzing tracking behavior and prompt-injection vectors.
